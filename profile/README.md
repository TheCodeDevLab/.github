# TheCode

This is the organisation of the project TheCode, the non-random password 
generator!

The idea behind the project is to generate a secure password using a secret key & the website name.
In short, you need to remember a simple key and by using the same simple key in addition to the website name, you have a very secure password.
You have strong & different passwords for all your accounts by remembering only one key.

As soon as you enter the name of the website and your secret key, it will be hashed with SHA256.
With the hexadecimal data generated by the hash, it converts it into a new base with the characters chosen (lower alphabet, upper alphabet, numbers...).

You don't have to remember a difficult key, it can be short and always the same, because the password generated will be long & different for each site.
However, if your key leaks or can be found, be aware that some malicious person can use the application to find the password.

Thanks to the hash function, no one who intercepts a password (in a mass leak for example) can find the secret key behind it. In deed, the hash function cannot be inverted.

The app is available on iOS, Mac, Android, Python app and web.
